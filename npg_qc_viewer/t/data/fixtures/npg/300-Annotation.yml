  comment: "Lots of fluorescent blobs in lane 1, some in L2 & a few in L3. Except for Lanes 1, 2 & 3, who's G intensities are very low, all other intensities are good to very good. Lane 1, 2 & 3 are very sparse. Lanes 5 & 6 are on the sparse side. Run looks nice with no problems seen. FC42GJDAAXX. Now on R1 C24/76."

  comment: '76 cyc PE runs: Lanes 5 & 6 - PASS; Rest - FAIL. Yield of 10.7 Gbases. %Error rates of 0.9 (R1) and 0.8 (R2). Lanes 1, 2 & 3 are of good quality, but too sparse and have insufficient yield. Lanes 7 & 8 have poor first cyc intensities in R2 and have poor looking %basecall IVCs. Lane 5 has some contaminants.

  comment: Across all lanes missing the bottom of T's 1 & 100. Either lack of oil or footprint issue. Will chase it next week. Now on C3/152.

  comment: '76 cycle PE run. Lanes 1, 2 & 3 FAIL. Rest Pass. Yield of 23 Gbases. %Error rates of 0.6 (R1) and 0.7 (R2). Lanes 1 to 3 are too dense & have lower %PF (60-71). Also intensities dropped during late cycles & %basecall plots are not pretty. '
